# z-o-lite

My first React application!
This exercise has helped me learn: 

* Splitting an app/site into components
* Working with both class/state and function/display components
* Data flow between different components through props
* Rerendering components based on user interaction
* Component life cycle and event handlers based on where it is in the cycle
* More about ES6, especially anonymous arrow functions and 'this' context retention
